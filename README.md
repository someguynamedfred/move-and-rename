# Hackhog's Move and Rename
This is an extremely simple script that renames a text file names "subtitle.txt" to whatever you input and then moves that file to a directory called "toupload".
It has a very specific use case. I have been downloading the transcripts for coursera videos and then uploading them to NotebookLM. I wanted something to upload the file and then move it to its own folder to upload en masse. 
Feel free to take, remake, and make it your own.
